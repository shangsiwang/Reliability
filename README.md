# Reliability

The project is to study relationship between reliability and predictability


## Results
- theory
  - def of R 
  - R bounds predictive accuracy for any subsequent task
  - Rhat --> E(R)
- simulation
  - Rhat --> E(R) in practice for some (eg, gaussian) simulation
  - Rhat provides a more useful bound than ICC or I2C2 for a variety of simulated settings
  - we can use Rhat to choose the most discriminable parameter (eg, threshold)
- real 
  1. optimal reliablity yields optimal predictive accuracy
  1. best pipeline = product of marginals
  2. thresholding vs. binning ranks
  3. which atlas/resolution
  4. DTI vs. fMRI

@jovo make each of the above points into a sentence.
